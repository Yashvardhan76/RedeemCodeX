# [sync-description]
# Determines whether a property is to sync with the template or not.
# Set this to `true` to lock the property and prevent direct modifications through `/rcx modify code`.
# Set this to `false` to allow modifications via `/rcx modify code`.
#
# [Note]
# - Setting this to `false` does not stop the property from inheriting the specified value during code creation (e.g., `/rcx gen`).
# - This type of restriction applies only to the `/rcx modify code` command.
#
# This serves as a basic "Sync System" for templates, indicating whether the property should synchronize with the template file or remain independent.
